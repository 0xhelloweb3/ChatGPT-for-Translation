Abstract
摘要
Nonprofit organizations contribute to a democratic society by allowing those with diverse opinions to assemble and voice these ideas. Social media has provided an extensive new marketplace in which such organizations can give voice to their ideas. Thus the purpose of this study was to explore and assess the use of social media (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) for advocacy by nonprofit organizations with diametrically opposed points-ofview on two social issues, the pro-gun/gun control issue and the pro-choice/pro-life issue. Results of this study indicate that nonprofit advocacy organizations are using social media to ethically persuade people to their point of view, for the most part through use of one-way communication. Moreover, organizations are using the various social media for different purposes, providing thanks and recognition on Twitter, and soliciting feedback and other two-way communication with stakeholders on Facebook. Use of authority figures to communicate messages is generally reserved for YouTube.
非营利组织通过允许持有不同意见的人聚集并表达这些观点，为民主社会做出了贡献。社交媒体为这些组织提供了一个广泛的新市场，可以让它们表达自己的观点。因此，本研究的目的是探讨和评估非营利组织在两个社会问题上（支持枪支/枪支管制问题和支持选择权/反对堕胎问题）使用社交媒体（Facebook、Twitter 和 YouTube）进行倡导的情况，这些组织的立场存在明显的对立。研究结果表明，非营利倡导组织正在使用社交媒体通过单向传播的方式，道德地说服人们接受他们的观点。此外，组织正在使用不同的社交媒体来实现不同的目的，在 Twitter 上表示感谢和认可，在 Facebook 上征求反馈和其他的双向沟通。在 YouTube 上通常保留使用权威人物作为信息传递的方式。
Introduction
介绍
The rise of social media has affected more than just communication practices -it has provided a substantial new platform for the democratization of interests and ideas by dramatically expanding the opportunity for expression of competing and controversial ideas in society. In doing so it has also has expanded and altered the importance of public relations. No longer are individuals and groups hindered by lack of access to print media or the limited dissemination of such collateral. Today, individuals and organizations may promote and persuade using the various platforms and tools of social media, potentially reaching anyone in cyberspace. And within organizations, the task of understanding and making use of such technologies to promote and persuade frequently falls under the guise of public relations.
社交媒体的兴起不仅影响了交流方式，而且在显著扩大了竞争和争议观点表达的机会，从而促进了兴趣和思想的民主化平台。这样做也扩大和改变了公共关系的重要性。个人和组织不再受制于缺乏印刷媒体访问渠道或受限的传播。现在，个人和组织可以使用各种平台和社交媒体工具进行宣传和说服，潜在地触及数字空间中的任何人。在组织内部，理解并利用这些技术以促进和说服的任务通常属于公共关系的范畴。
While all types of organizations are engaging in social media, it is particularly important for nonprofits to do so as they rely on individual support in the form of donations and volunteers, and they also rely on general public support for their very existence. Formation of nonprofit organizations can be seen as the result of the 1st Amendment, a cornerstone of American democracy. As far back as the early 1800s, Alexander de Tocqueville identified one of the unique and enduring features of this democratic society -the freedom for individuals to form organizations with like-minded people to address social issues through persuasion and advocacy. He did not identify the simultaneous opportunity for those with opposing viewpoints to organize, persuade and advocate on the same issue from their point-of-view, but in fact the 1st Amendment does so.
虽然各种类型的组织都参与社交媒体，但对于非营利组织来说，这尤为重要，因为他们依赖于个人的支持，以形式上的捐赠和志愿者的贡献，同时也依赖于公众对他们的支持。非营利组织的成立可以看作是美国民主的基石之一——第一修正案的结果。早在19世纪初，托克维尔就认为这个民主社会的一个独特和持久的特征是——个人自由与志同道合的人形成组织，通过说服和宣传来解决社会问题。他没有看到与之同时出现的，那些持相反观点的人组织、说服和宣传的机会，但实际上第一修正案确实提供了这样的机会。
In the U.S. such organizations are generally formed as tax-exempt or nonprofit organizations and are considered part of civil society or the third sector (Lohmann, 1992) as opposed to the government or business sectors of society. Though the size of the sector decreased in 2011 for the first time in decades as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) purged their records of inactive groups, it is still large with 1,629,149 registered Tax-Exempt Organizations and Nonexempt Charitable Trusts reported (IRS, 2012). Within the sector, individual organizational missions may be predominantly lacking in contentious ideas, or extremely contentious, for example the points-of-view espoused by the National Rifle Association (NRA) or Planned Parenthood.
在美国，这种组织通常以免税或非营利组织的形式成立，并被视为社会公民或第三个领域的一部分（Lohmann，1992），而不同于政府或商业部门。尽管该领域的规模在2011年出现了数十年来首次下降，因为国内收入局（IRS）清除了其记录中的失效团体，但仍然庞大，报告了1,629,149个注册的免税组织和非豁免慈善信托（IRS，2012）。在该领域内，个体组织的使命可能主要缺乏有争议的想法，或者是极具争议的，例如全国步枪协会（NRA）或计划生育组织所支持的观点。
Communication of advocacy organizations' ideas may appear unduly biased or one-sided because of the passion those involved feel about their cause; however, it has been argued that democratic debate requires persuasion to alter the minds and behaviours of publics (Pattie & Johnston, 2008). Though often seen as a less optimal form of communication than two-way communication or dialogue, persuasion is a function of public relations and falls within the scope of advocacy. According to the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) advocacy is the first of six core professional behaviours that practitioners should exhibit. Advocacy is defined as "[serving] the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for those we represent. We provide a voice in the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate" (PRSA, 2012). Providing a voice in the marketplace of ideas is inherently democratic in nature as it provides just one voice or idea in a pluralistic marketplace full of contradictory, conflicting, and supporting ideas. Within nonprofit organizations the role of public relations is central to the dissemination of core values and building of support.
倡导组织的理念沟通可能因涉及者对其事业的热情而显得过于偏颇或单极。但是，据认为民主辩论需要说服力来改变公众的思想和行为（Pattie＆Johnston，2008）。尽管说服力常常被视为与双向交流或对话相比不够理想的一种传播方式，但它是公共关系的一种功能并属于倡导的范畴。根据美国公共关系协会（PRSA）的规定，倡导是从业者应该表现出的六项核心专业行为中的第一项。倡导被定义为“以代表我们所代表的人为负责任的倡导者的身份来为公众利益服务。我们在思想，事实和观点的市场中提供一个声音，以帮助形成理性的公共辩论”（PRSA，2012）。在思想的市场中提供一个声音本质上具有民主意义，因为它提供了一个声音或观点，而在充满矛盾，冲突和支持不同观点的多元市场中。在非营利组织内，公共关系的作用对于传播核心价值观和建立支持至关重要。
Initially, the Internet provided organizations with space for organizational communication such as websites where content was often static. The dramatic shift of social networking sites from providing space for interpersonal communication to also providing for organization-public communication has changed the landscape for the marketplace of ideas. No longer can organizations allow information to remain static but the information they provide must compete with many more voices in the vast online communities of cyberspace, and the information must be timely, responsive, persuasive and transparent to compete within this large marketplace of ideas.
最初，互联网为组织提供了一些组织间沟通的空间，比如通常内容比较静态的网站。社交网络网站从提供人际交往空间到还提供组织与公众交往的机会，导致市场理念的格局出现了剧变。组织不能再让提供的信息保持静态，而是必须在广阔的网络社区中与众多声音竞争，提供及时、有回应性、有说服力且公开透明的信息才能在市场理念的大舞台上脱颖而出。
Thus the purpose of this study was to explore and assess the use of social media (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) for advocacy by nonprofit organizations with diametrically opposed points-of-view. Such organizations are created through the democratic freedoms of the 1st Amendment and their ideas represent the diversity and uniqueness of such government. As purveyors of these ideas to stakeholders of all kinds, it is important for public relations practitioners to understand how best to use social media for advocacy while encouraging increased communication of democratic interests and diversity in society.
因此，本研究的目的是探讨和评估非营利组织使用社交媒体（Facebook、Twitter和YouTube）进行倡导的可行性和效果，这些组织拥有截然相反的观点。这些组织是通过第一修正案所赋予的民主自由而创立的，它们的观念代表了政府的多样性和独特性。作为向各种利益相关者传达这些观念的传播者，公共关系从业者理解如何最好地利用社交媒体进行倡导，同时促进民主利益和社会多样性的增加是非常重要的。
Literature review
文献综述
This study incorporates the concepts of nonprofit organizations in a democratic society, the role of public relations in communicating diverse ideas in the marketplace of ideas, and the significance of social media in providing new platforms and opportunities for communication of such ideas. Each of these concepts is addressed in turn, beginning with nonprofit organizations in a democratic society.
本研究将非营利组织在民主社会中的概念、公共关系在传递多元化思想市场中的作用以及社交媒体在提供新平台和交流这些思想的机会的重要性结合起来。每个概念依次进行讨论，从非营利组织在民主社会中开始。
Nonprofit organizations and democratic society
非营利组织与民主社会
Democracy in America is founded on the principles found within the First Amendment to the Constitution which grants individuals the freedoms of religion, the press, free speech, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. In the early 1800s Alexander de Tocqueville wrote glowingly of American's propensity to assemble, or form associations to address social needs. He noted:
美国的民主是建立在宪法第一修正案所涵盖的原则之上的，在该修正案中赋予了人们宗教信仰的自由、新闻媒体的自由、言论自由、集会的权利以及向政府请愿以获得救济的权利。在19世纪初，亚历山大·德·托克维尔赞赏美国人倾向于聚集或组成社团来解决社会需求的性格。他指出：
In no country in the world has the principle of association been more successfully used or applied to a greater multitude of objects than in America. Besides the permanent associations which are established by law under the names of townships, cities, and counties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the agency of private individuals. (Chapter 12, para.1) He identified broad areas in which associations had been formed to address social issues such as intemperance, public safety, industry, and religion and concluded, "there is no end which the human will despairs of attaining through the combined power of individuals united into a society (Chapter 12, para. 3)".
在世界上没有一个国家像美国一样，协会原则得到更成功的应用，服务于更多的对象。除了根据法律成立的名为城镇、城市和郡的永久性协会外，还有大量协会由私人成立和维持。（第12章，第1段）他指出成立的协会所涉及的广泛领域，如对付温饱、公共安全、工业和宗教等社会问题，并得出结论：“没有哪一个人类的意志会绝望于通过一个社会团结在一起的个人联合的力量而无法达成的最后目标”（第12章，第3段）。
Today, these associations are known collectively as nonprofit organizations and are categorized by the IRS into 25 broad groups including the 501(c)(3) religious and charitable organizations to whom monetary contributions are tax deductible, and the remaining 24 categories including the 501(c)(4) public welfare organizations, to which contributions are not tax deductible. According to the IRS, today there are more than 1,600,000 nonprofit organizations in the U.S. (IRS, 2012). Some suggest that the vitality of the nonprofit sector is paramount to the continuation of a democratic society and that these organizations have an obligation to society to promote the needs of their constituents. As Greely (2006) explained,"Theory, history and practice have shown that a vibrant, independent, nonprofit sector is critical to democracy. As such nonprofits have an obligation to represent their constituents' needs to the government, media, and public at large" (p. 14). Such representation falls under the role of public relations, which has been defined as "the management of communication between an organization and its publics" (Grunig & Hunt, 1984, p. 6). And among the core types of communication techniques used by public relations is that of advocacy, addressed next.
今天，这些组织被统称为非营利组织，并被IRS分为25个大类，其中包括可以享受税收减免的501(c)(3)宗教和慈善组织，以及其余24个类别，包括不能享受税收减免的501(c)(4)公共福利组织。根据IRS的数据，今天美国有超过1,600,000个非营利组织（IRS，2012年）。有人认为，非营利领域的活力对于一个民主社会的继续非常重要，这些组织有责任宣传其选民的需求。正如格里利（Greely）（2006年）所解释的那样，“理论、历史和实践都表明，一个充满活力、独立的非营利部门对于民主至关重要。因此，非营利组织有义务向政府、媒体和公众宣传代表其选民的需要”（第14页）。这种代表作用属于公共关系的范畴，公共关系被定义为“组织与其公众之间管理沟通的过程”（Grunig＆Hunt，1984年，第6页）。“倡导”是公共关系所使用的核心传播技术之一，接下来将进行讨论。
Public relations advocacy
公共关系倡导
The role of advocacy in public relations can be as quiet as reminding upper management of the concerns of local citizens to proposed actions by the organization, or as visible as professional lobbyists and issues advocates. And despite its importance, advocacy is often portrayed as a less satisfactory form of public relations than engaging in a dialogic process or building relationships with publics. In fact some equate advocacy with propaganda, perhaps as Freeman (2009) suggests, because "the communication materials of activist groups who are passionate about their cause. . .may appear close-minded or one-sided" (p. 271). Yet not all propaganda or persuasive communication need be unethical. As Freeman (2009) explains, "propaganda has some distinctive and largely negative characteristics that distinguish it from mere persuasive speech" (p. 271). Such distinctive characteristics include purposely distorting the message and misrepresenting information as well as concealing the source of the messenger from the audience. Further, propaganda may also reduce complex issues into suggestions of simple cause and effect, rely on the use of authority figures, and may place "emphasis on conflict over cooperation" (Freeman, 2009, p. 271).
宣传在公共关系中的角色可以像提醒组织的上层管理当地居民对组织的提议的关注一样低调，也可以像专业游说者和问题倡导者一样引人瞩目。尽管其重要性不言而喻，但宣传往往被描绘为比与公众展开有对话过程或建立关系更为不满意的公共关系形式。事实上，一些人将宣传与宣传相提并论，或许正如Freeman（2009年）所建议的那样，因为“热情为其事业倾注，通常会被视为执着、以过分狭窄的视角看待世界的活动家组织的传播材料...”（p. 271）。 然而，并不是所有宣传或说服性沟通都需要不道德。正如Freeman（2009年）所解释的，“宣传具有某些独特且很大程度上具有负面特征，这些特征区别于纯粹的说服性言辞”（p. 271）。这些独特特征包括有意扭曲信息消息和隐瞒使者的来源，以及将复杂的问题简单化为因果关系的建议，依赖于权威人士，并可能强调冲突而不是合作（Freeman，2009年，第271页）。
Because issues advocacy promotes the point-of-view from just one side of a social issue, it is often seen as a controversial form of communication. Such communication "moves beyond the traditional realm of promoting an organization's image, product, or service, into efforts to influence a legislative or regulatory outcome or a public policy debate" (Miller, 2006, p. 1). Despite its controversial nature, such persuasion is necessary to develop debate in the marketplace of ideas. For example, Pattie and Johnston (2008) contended, "Democratic debate depends upon the possibility of (hopefully rational) persuasion to change minds and behaviours" (p. 678).
由于议题倡导通常只从社会问题的一方面出发，因此被视为一种具有争议性的沟通形式。这种沟通“超越了传统的推广组织形象、产品或服务的范畴，而是努力影响立法或监管结果或公共政策辩论”（米勒，2006年，第1页）。尽管具有争议性，但这种说服是发展思想市场中辩论的必要手段。例如，帕蒂和约翰斯顿（2008年）认为，“民主辩论取决于改变思想和行为的可能性（希望是理性的）说服”（第678页）。
Among the key factors in developing persuasive appeals is the use of message strategy. As discussed below, several studies have examined the use and effectiveness of message strategy by nonprofit organizations.
在发展有说服力的呼吁时，使用信息策略是关键因素之一。正如以下所讨论的那样，一些研究已经审查了非营利组织使用信息策略的方式和效果。
Message strategy
信息策略
Studies have examined the importance of message structure in garnering support for advocated issues (Miller, 2006;Scudder & Mills, 2009;Weberling, 2012). In a study of shock advocacy Scudder and Mills (2009) found that the shock messages used by a nonprofit advocacy group were effective against the animal food processing industry without harming the reputation of the advocacy group. Moreover, through analysis of messages from industries whose behaviour could compromise the environment, Miller (2006) found that messages that focused on community identity, "using emotional appeals to highlight the community's sense of tradition and heritage" (p. 22), had the greatest effect on recipients. Messages that related to individual benefits from the industry's engagement with the community, such as increased prosperity and employment, were also influential.
研究探讨了信息结构在为倡导的问题获取支持中的重要性（米勒，2006;斯卡德和米尔斯，2009;韦伯林，2012）。在一项有关"震惊"式倡导的研究中，斯卡德和米尔斯（2009）发现，非营利倡导组织使用的震惊信息对动物食品加工行业十分有效，而不会损害倡导组织的声誉。此外，米勒（2006）通过分析那些行为可能影响环境的行业的信息，发现聚焦于社区身份的信息“使用情感呼吁来突出社区的传统和遗产意识”（第22页）对受众影响最大。与行业与社区合作中个人受益有关的信息，例如增加的繁荣和就业机会，也具有影响力。
Further, in a qualitative content analysis of e-mail messages, Weberling (2012) identified three types of messages sent by a large nonprofit organization known for its advocacy on women's health -advocacy, fundraising, and news type messages. She noted that the advocacy and fundraising messages employed different rhetoric with advocacy messages designed to inspire logical decision-making and fundraising to appeal to readers' emotional decision-making. As such, the advocacy messages included facts and figures and in-depth information, while the fundraising messages "focused on hope, survival, and the 'face' of breast cancer" (p. 114).
此外，在对电子邮件信息进行定性内容分析的研究中，韦伯林 (Weberling) (2012) 发现了由一家以女性健康倡导著称的大型非盈利组织发送的三种信息类型 - 倡导、筹款和新闻类型。她指出，倡导和筹款信息采用不同的修辞，倡导信息旨在激励逻辑决策，而筹款则是为了吸引读者的情感决策。因此，倡导信息包括事实和数据以及深入信息，而筹款信息则“聚焦于希望、生存和乳腺癌的‘脸’” (第114页)。
Advancing the study of advocacy in the online environment, Waters and Lord (2009) examined how advocacy groups build relationships on the Internet. Though the study found mixed support for how well these organizations integrated relationship-building into their website design, the authors provided several guidelines for improvement among which were listening and acting upon feedback and comments. Rapid changes in the development of online social media such as the social networking site Facebook and micro-blogging site Twitter have not lessened the soundness of these guidelines, though a great deal more research on social media, and the use of such media by nonprofits has ensued, as discussed below.
推进网络环境中宣传学的研究，沃特斯和洛德（2009）研究了倡导组织如何在互联网上建立关系。尽管该研究发现这些组织在网站设计中整合关系建立的支持存在争议，但作者提供了几个改进的指南，其中包括听取和采纳反馈和评论。在线社交媒体的快速发展，如社交网络网站Facebook和微博网站Twitter，并没有减弱这些指南的合理性，尽管对社交媒体的研究以及非营利组织的使用已经出现了大量研究，如下所述。
Nonprofit organizations use of social media
非营利组织使用社交媒体
Long gone are the days when organizations could consider themselves technologically up-to-date simply because they developed a website. Today, organizations must also be engaged in social media, a type of media that could not have been envisaged as part of organizational communication even at the start of the new millennium. As Saxton, Guo, and Brown (2007) noted, "the increasingly sophisticated second-generation Web technologies enable an intensity of interactions between [nonprofit] organizations and citizens and consumers in ways not previously possible" (p.144). They suggest that to achieve the goals of their missions, organizations must strategically consider the amount of information and interactivity of content that they provide to stakeholders in the online environment.
现在已经过去了那些仅因为有网站就自认为技术更新的组织的日子。今天，组织必须也要参与社交媒体，这是一种即使在新千年之初也无法想象作为组织交流的一部分的媒体类型。正如Saxton、Guo和Brown（2007）所指出的那样，“日益复杂的第二代网络技术使（非营利）组织与公民和消费者之间的交互达到了前所未有的强度”（第144页）。他们建议组织在在线环境中为利益相关者提供信息和互动内容，以便达成其使命目标。
Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are by their very nature, built upon user interaction. Recent research by Lovejoy and Saxton (2012) categorized nonprofit organizations' use of Twitter into three major functions, Information, Action, and Community. Information related to provision of news about the organization and its activities, while the purpose of Community was to build relationships and create networks. The final function, Action, was comprised of items encouraging followers to engage in some kind of action such as donating, volunteering, or attending an event.
社交网络网站如Facebook和Twitter本质上是建立在用户互动的基础之上的。Lovejoy和Saxton（2012）最近的研究将非营利组织在Twitter上的使用分类为三个主要功能：信息、行动和社区。信息与组织及其活动相关的新闻提供有关，而社区的目的是建立关系和创建网络。最后一个功能Action包括鼓励追随者参与某种行动，例如捐赠，志愿服务或参加活动。
Earlier research found that nonprofit organizations were not using Facebook to full potential. Though these organizations were transparent with the information provided in their organizational profile, they were not using the social networking capabilities of Facebook to "inform others and get them involved in organizational activities" (Waters et al., 2009, p. 106). Moreover, several studies have found one-way communication to be the predominant form of communication used by organizations on both Facebook and Twitter (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009;Lovejoy, Waters, & Saxton, 2012;Xifra & Grau, 2010). Conversely, in their examination of the American Red Cross's use of social media, Briones, Kuch, Liu, and Jin (2011) discovered the use of two-way dialogue, in particular in development of relationships with younger constituents, the local community, and the media.
早先的研究发现，非盈利组织没有充分利用 Facebook。虽然这些组织在他们的组织简介中提供了透明的信息，但他们并没有利用 Facebook 的社交网络功能来“加强他人对组织活动的认知并让他们参与其中”(Waters等人，2009年，第106页)。此外，几项研究发现，在 Facebook 和 Twitter 上，单向传播是组织使用的主要通信形式（Bortree和Seltzer，2009年；Lovejoy、Waters和Saxton，2012年；Xifra和Grau，2010年）。相反，在研究美国红十字会使用社交媒体方面时，Briones、Kuch、Liu和Jin (2011) 发现了使用双向对话特别是在与年轻选民、当地社区和媒体产生关系方面。
Little research has been conducted on the social implications of a third major social media site, that of YouTube. YouTube is the top video site in the world with an estimated 2 billion views per day (YouTube, 2011). The video sharing site has grown exponentially since the first video was uploaded in April 2005 to the point where an estimated 24 h of video is now uploaded every minute (YouTube, 2011). A study by English, Sweetser, and Ancu (2011) examined the use of persuasive appeals in political videos and found that "source credibility, [was] the highest-ranked appeal in terms of credibility among the participants in [the] study" (p. 744). Moreover, the use of humour appeals was far less successful than the use of fact-based arguments.
目前关于社交媒体第三大平台——YouTube的社会影响方面仍未有太多研究。YouTube是世界最大的视频分享网站，据估计每天有20亿的观看量（Youtube，2011年）。自2005年4月首个视频上传以来，这一视频分享网站的增长呈现指数级上涨，现在每一分钟就有约24小时的视频被上传 (Youtube，2011年)。 English、Sweetser和Ancu (2011年) 的一项研究调查了政治视频中的说服手法，并发现在参与研究的人群中，"来源可信度是排名最高的说服手法" (p. 744)。此外，幽默的说服手法要比基于事实的说服手法不成功得多。
Based on the importance of nonprofit organizations to a democratic society, the pluralistic and democratic marketplace of ideas, the importance of communicating persuasively within that marketplace, and the need to engage stakeholders with these ideas, the following research questions are proposed: RQ1. How are nonprofit advocacy groups contributing to the democratic marketplace of ideas through social media? RQ2. Have nonprofit advocacy groups moved beyond one-way communication in social media?
基于非营利组织对于民主社会的重要性、多元化和民主化的思想市场、在这个市场中有效沟通的重要性以及需要与利益相关者共同探讨这些思想，我们提出以下研究问题：RQ1.非营利组织借助社交媒体如何贡献于民主思想市场？RQ2.非营利组织在社交媒体上是否已经超越单向传播的限制？
